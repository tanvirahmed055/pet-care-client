        "detailDescription": "Dental care is often an overlooked aspect of healthcare in animals. Animals suffer from cavities, plaque and tartar buildup, gum disease, and even abscessed teeth. Regular professional cleanings help keep your pet's teeth healthy and alert you to potential problems. Periodontal disease can develop when plaque and tartar build up underneath the gums. If the bacteria that caused the plaque enters your pet's bloodstream, it can create heart, lung, and kidney problems. Signs that indicate your pet needs dental care include bad breath, lack of appetite, crying when eating, and lethargy.",

Collars fall off or can be removed, while a Microchip is a permanent source of identification for your pet. A Microchip is a uniquely numbered chip, about the size of a grain of rice that is injected under the skin of a family pet through a special needle. The chip bears a number that can be accessed by the service provider to reveal your pet's name, along with your name, address, and phone number, and the veterinary clinic that placed the chip. If your pet is ever lost, Microchipping increases the chances of a safe and happy return. Pet Medical Center participates in a nation-wide microchipping program that increases the chances of a safe recovery.",
